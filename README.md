# Rock-Paper-Scissors
My first js project

What I want to make is a game that lets me play rock paper scissors against the computer:
1. I will enter a value of either rock, paper or scissors into the machine.
2. The machine will randomly choose rock, paper or scissors themselves.
3. The computer should then take these two values and compare them where Scissors > Paper > Rock > Scissors
4. When this is completed, the computer will tell the user whether the computer won, the user won, or it was in fact a draw (if both players chose the same variable)
